# Terminal

This package aims to aid in the making of Command-Line Applications by providing an API to wrap
ANSI commands.

The package contains two modules: `Terminal` and `TerminalUI`.
The later is currently unusable as it is way too experimental

*Any help, comments or interest would be welcome!*

## Terminal

A simple API wrapped in the `Terminal` class to allow using the terminal to it's *(almost)* full power!

## TerminalUI - DO NOT USE

A **very** experimental UI system for the terminal, it aims to be close to SwiftUI.
